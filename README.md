# concert-event-website
Code for my project for *Codepath's WEB101: Introduction to Web Development* course!

## Project Overview
Students are tasked with creating a website for an event. My website advertises the Intermission Orchestra at UC Berkeley's December 2025 concert and features a responsive layout using HTML and CSS. 

Key features include 1) event listeners to _toggle between light/dark mode and reduced motion for accessibility_, 2) an _HTML form with client-side input validation_, and 3) _JavaScript animations and a popup modal_ upon entry of a valid RSVP. 

## Reflection and Future Considerations

### Challenges Faced
The project was initially created in VSCode EDU, an online cloud-based IDE. I ended up running into a recurring problem where new updates to files were not saving, followed by the database connection closing, and ultimately leading to an indcator that the file did not exist, causing me to lose all of my files on two occasions. As a result, I learned early on the importance of keeping a second backup of my files!  

### Lessons Learned
As WEB101 is an introductory web development course, it focused primarily on the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, web design principles, layouts using the box method and flexbox, and basic animations. 
### Future Improvements

### Future Considerations
Future features I'd like to implement:
- Connecting the RSVP form to a database
- Revamping the links section and Event About section for aesthetics
