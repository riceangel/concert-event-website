# concert-event-website
Code for my project for Codepath's WEB101 Introduction to Web Development course!

Students are tasked with creating a website for an event. My website highlights the Intermission Orchestra at Berkeley's upcoming December 2025 concert and features a responsive layout using HTML and CSS. 

Features include event listeners to toggle between light/dark mode and reduced  motion, an HTML form with client-side input validation, and JavaScript animations upon entry of a valid RSVP.
